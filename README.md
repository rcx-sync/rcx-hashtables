RCX Hashtables
==============

This directory contains source code for hash table implementations protected by
RCX, RCU, RLU, RCU-HTM, and few more alternatives and a program for evaluation
of the performance of the tables.

Please note that this is a fork of the RLU (https://github.com/rlu-sync/rlu)
and considerably modified, though the code for RLU-protected hash tables are
unmodified.
